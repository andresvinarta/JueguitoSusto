  NoteText: "Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok\xE9mon
    breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok\xE9mon for humans? Not only are
    they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are
    an average of 3\u201D03\u2019 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they\u2019re large
    enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for
    HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water
    based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would
    be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without
    getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate,
    Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d
    be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water
    Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water.
    No other Pok\xE9mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact,
    if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally
    built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can
    take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"
